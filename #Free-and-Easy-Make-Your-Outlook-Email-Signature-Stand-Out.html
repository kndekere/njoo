            <p>hi I'm Jamie and welcome to teachers Tech today I want to show you how you can make  an amazing looking email signature very professional in a matter of  a few minutes in the new Microsoft Outlook so it would look like this  and the great thing that you have a lot of customization options and it's completely free so I just want to point out I'm in the new Microsoft Outlook so if I go up to the top right  hand corner you can see I've toggled this on and have set that up I have a whole video on  how to use the new Microsoft Outlook uh and I'll put a link to that up above in the cart and down  below in the description if I take a look at this email signature here that would be at the  bottom of my emails that I send to someone this is totally custom uh customizable and these are  links inside of here so if I just hover over you can see these are live links in here if  I go down below even on the social media as well those are going to be links that would  actually go to those and this is a very quick setup so let me show you the website that you  can use for free to do this so the site you're going to go to is signature hound and I'll put  the link to this down below in the description you can see right here that signature Hound is  completely free so once you go to the site if you don't have an account just go ahead and do  the free sign up here it will just take you about a minute and then we'll go on to the next step  one once you're logged in you're going to see any previous email signatures that have been created  and saved here you can always go back to them again and use different ones and copy them out  but for this little tutorial I'm going to go and create a brand new one by clicking here but you  can also click new signature up top so I'm going to create a new signature this is just going to be  called teachers Tech uh demo just for the demo purposes and I'm going to go ahead and create  right now so the next step is to just go ahead and pick a template to start with so if I just  scroll down this is what it's selected right now you can see how this is highlighted if I  choose another one I'll go down here you'll see right away how it changes the layout so if you  click on any of these it gives you a quick look of what you would like to create for this demo  I'm just staying with this one right here uh and we're going to go through and fill out all this  information so to do that we are going to just go ahead and go to personal information first  and we're going to work down all these different Taps so we this is where we put our image here I  can collect uh select file or I can just drag it over so I have an image right here on my desktop  and I'm just going to drag this over I can clear this if I didn't want it if I pick the wrong image  I can hit clear and it's gone so I'm just going to drag it over again to place it in and as soon  as I do put this in you can see how it populates over here on the side as well I can go and change  the profile width of this so if I uh change it so you can see how it quickly changes with the  preview as well so you can get it just the way you want lots of customization option now with  this rest of this information I'm just going to go through and fill it out so it's as simple as  just putting your name and as soon as you do this it places it over here so go place this  information here I'm just going to quickly fill it out so I quickly filled out this information  and it's populated over here don't worry about this signature Hound right here I'm going to show  you how to get rid of this on the next step and I have my email placed in right through here so  notice if I hover over right away this is going to be a link so if people click on it it will open up  the email here so we get all this information here and then we can go to the next step of business info now again I have an image that I can place in here so if you have a maybe a logo or something  something like that you can place it in I have this I'm going to drag it over and it gets placed  right here and again I can change my size here by clicking on it and dragging this this is where uh  the signature Hound is coming up right here so if I clear it and I didn't want that at all I can go  ahead and do that so I am going to leave it blank for this demo I can go and place my information  right through here my address uh for this demo I'm just going to leave this exactly the same name now  if I take a look at the address map URL here I'm not going to put anything in here but if you're  wondering what this is about you can see some email clients will recognize your address and  make it Blue by link then if you specify it you can sure that the text won't change so anytime  there's something that you're not sure what it is just hover over it and I'm I'm not making changes  to these but uh you can see that they give you a little bit more information all the time now I'm  going to put my address in here my website so all I'm going to do is just paste over top of it and  you can see over here it becomes teachers.



Tech and this is a link to my website so if I click  it it will go there then we have our different social media the one error I noticed that they  have they don't have X updated on this they still have Twitter uh you can add and take away these so  if I was going to take away Twitter I can just quickly go through and add the ones I want if  I wanted to add more or take away so if I just wanted my YouTube here then I could go ahead and  take my YouTube channel address or just adding my uh adding my at here so I'm just going to  clear it and paste it over here just like that now this will be a link to my YouTube channel so you  can have many social media there if you would like and then again you have some option to allow users  to override the social media icons as we go up to design this is where we're going to change things  like the icon showing the colors in the this uh email signature and we can toggle on or off the  icons so if you can see here they're gone and I can toggle them back on as well we have different  icon types so if I drop down here and click this top what do I want do I want a circular one here  or do I want to keep things the same so if I go and just say this one it changes the style here  so if I want to close this just click on this top one again and it closes we can change our  icon size by just dragging that I'm going to leave that the same social media icon do I want to keep  it as well in the circles so if I click here it just adjust to that one and click this to close  it so these are going to be the divided lines on or off again you can get really customized on on  all of this information whether the size now the theme color uh the blue doesn't match what I'm  putting in my uh different ones with my uh logo and different things so maybe I want to go find  a closer color to it and I can pick one and I'm not going to get this very exact here but as I  find it you can see this changes these lines and if I go ahead and just click on the color again  it closes icon color I could go back to this and take this if I got a color I could copy it contrl  C close it go back and just if I wanted the same color paste it in on all of these same thing with  the social media go back and paste it in but if you knew your your hex color you could place it  in as well so the text color on teachers.

Free & Easy: Make Your Outlook Email Signature Stand Out!

 



Tech do I do I want that differently so again I can  change this and place it if I wanted to uh keep everything kind of in a similar way going through  you can see from line Heights from spacing and separate the website on or off like that and this  is where you're going to get rid of the created by uh this right at the bottom where it says  created by signature Hound if I just turn this on off that will go away so we have all our colors  and everything set let's go to the next part the call to action now I don't have it on this one a  called up action but if you want what it does you could put another image in here and I'm just going  to drag this logo back in and it places this at the bottom so if it was a call to action U maybe  suggesting to the people that you email that they click on something you can go ahead and place the  image in here with it saying to do something to whoever reads your email and then this is going  to be clickable here as well so if they click on it it's going to bring them to what you were  telling them to but in my case here I'm just going to hit clear uh I don't want any call of  action I do want to point out the disclaimer at the bottom here so if I click disclaimer that's  this right here so where it says this content of the email we can clear this if you don't want it  go ahead and clear it like so so now you have your email created it's time to install it into the new  Microsoft Outlook just go up to the top and select install signature so I'm going to select that and  you get lots of different options so I could be placing this in other email clients as well  I'm going to go to this Outlook one right here even though it says 2019 this will work for what  we're going to do so I'm going to select this one right here and it's going to say that this  might not work actually in the previous version of Microsoft Outlook it did do what they're saying  but in the new outlook it comes out the way it's supposed to look and things aren't underlined so  I'm just going to go if I scroll down they give instructions but these are for the older versions  I'm going to go ahead and just copy the signature and I can see at the bottom says signature copy to  the clipboard now what I need to do is go over to Microsoft Outlook and I'm going to go ahead  and create a new mail so I'm just clicking on new mail and this is where if I go under insert I can  go to Signature so if I go signature I don't have have any in there so I'm going to create  one so if I click signature here what account do I want this for so I don't want it for this one  this demo one I'm going to put it for this one here so make sure if you have multiple accounts  you go ahead and do that this is just going to be called demo I'm just going to place demo here for  the purposes and here all I have to do is paste it in so I'm going to go control uh v on it and  it's going to paste this in so I'll stretch this out so you can see this uh a little bit better uh  here and if I go through you can see all the information that we have right through there  that we created in signature Hound I'm just going to go ahead and hit save on this one uh and once  you can see I hit save it becomes part of the selection down here so where am I going to use  it so I can have it defaulted do I want this for every new mail to have so I could select uh demo  for this or for replies and forwards do I want want this email signature coming on uh I'm going  to leave these blank just for now but you can go ahead and select what options would be the best  I'm going to close out of this and a lot of times if you're writing an email if you just wanted to  add it in as you went around so I can go ahead and add this to whatever email that I made the account  for so what I mean is notice this email this isn't where I created this for because if I go to insert  signature it won't show up but if I switch to the account it's this one here uh now it's just going  to pop open here a new message if I go to insert signature there's the demo here and that was going  to be placed right at the bottom of this email so I can go ahead and I write my email up top here  add my subject line and this will automatically be added here remember in the default settings  of this I could have it turned on to go to uh to on every email but you also have the CH choice to  just add it as you go along as well so I'm just going to go ahead and actually send this email  to a couple of my email addresses to show you uh that it looks good on the other end and the format  works so hit send and let's take a look at it so here's the two different emails that I sent on the  left is in Gmail that uh we look at the formatting the lines aren't there like it used to be in the  previous version uh when sent from Outlook here the links work so if I click on it it will bring  me over to uh to my website and then here this is in Microsoft the new outlook and you can see  everything looks well in here so I hope you like this tutorial on how to create this professional  looking email in um in Microsoft the new outlook let me know how it works for you down below in the  comments thanks for watching this time I'll see you next week with more Tech tips and tutorials</p>
